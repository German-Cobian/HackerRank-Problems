// Two friends Anna and Brian, are deciding how to split the bill at a dinner. Each will only pay for the items 
// they consume. Brian gets the check and calculates Anna's portion. You must determine if his calculation is correct.

// For example, assume the bill has the following prices: bill = [2,4,6]. Anna declines to eat item k = bill[2]
// which costs 6. If Brian calculates the bill correctly, Anna will pay (2+4)/2 = 3. If he includes the cost 
// of bill[2], he will calculate (2+4+6)/2 = 6. In the second case, he should refund 3 to Anna.

// Function Description

// Complete the bonAppetit function in the editor below. It should print 'Bon Appetit' if the bill is fairly split.

// Otherwise, it should print the integer amount of money that Brian owes Anna.

// bonAppetit has the following parameter(s):

// * bill: an array of integers representing the cost of each item ordered
// * k: an integer representing the zero-based index of the item Anna doesn't eat
// * b: the amount of money that Anna contributed to the bill

// Input Format

// The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k, the number of items ordered and the 0-based 
// index of the item that Anna did not eat.
// The second line contains n space-separated integers bill[i] where 0 <= i < n.
// The third line contains an integer, b, the amount of money that Brian charged Anna for her share of the bill.

// Constraints
// * 2 <= n <= 10**5
// * 0 <= k < n
// * 0 <= bill[if] <= 10**4
// * 0 <= b <= âˆ‘ bill[i]

// * The amount of money due Anna will always be an integer

// Output Format

// If Brian did not overcharge Anna, print  'Bon Appetit' on a new line; otherwise, print the difference 
// (i.e., bcharged-bactual) that Brian must refund to Anna. This will always be an integer.

// Sample Input 0

// 4 1
// 3 10 2 9
// 12

// Sample Output 0

// 5
