// A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, the professor decides 
// to cancel class if fewer than some number of students are present when class starts. Arrival times go from on time 
// (arrivaTime <= 0) to arrived late (arrivalTime > 0).

// Given the arrival time of each student and a threshhold number of attendees, determine if the class is cancelled.

//Example

// n =5
// k =3
// a = [-2,-1,0,1,2]

// The first 3 students arrived on. The last 2 were late. The threshold is 3 students, so class will go on. Return YES.

// Note: Non-positive arrival times (a[i] <= 0) indicate the student arrived early or on time; positive arrival times 
// (a[i] > 0) indicate the student arrived a[i] minutes late.

// Function Description

// Complete the angryProfessor function in the editor below. It must return YES if class is cancelled, or NO otherwise.

// angryProfessor has the following parameter(s):

// * int k: the threshold number of students
// * int a[n]: the arrival times of the  students

// Returns

// *string: either YES or NO

// Input Format

// The first line of input contains t, the number of test cases.

// Each test case consists of two lines.

// The first line has two space-separated integers, n and k, the number of students (size of a) and the cancellation threshold.
// The second line contains n space-separated integers (a[i], a[2],...,a[n]) that describe the arrival times for each student.

//Constraints

// * 1 <= t <= 10
// * 1 <= n <= 1000
// * 1 <= k <= n
// * -100 <= a[i] <= 100 where i Â¢ [1,...n]

// Sample Input

// 2
// 4 3
// -1 -3 4 2
// 4 2
// 0 -1 2 1

// Sample Output

// YES
// NO
